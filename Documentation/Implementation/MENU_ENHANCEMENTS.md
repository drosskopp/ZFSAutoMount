# Menu Bar Enhancements

## Overview

The menu bar now shows **detailed dataset information** under each pool, including:
- Mount status (mounted/unmounted)
- Encryption status
- Real-time updates when datasets change

## What's New

### Enhanced Pool Display

Each pool now shows:
- **📦 Pool Name** - Visual indicator for pools
- **✅ Health Status** - ONLINE shows green checkmark, issues show warning
- **💾 Capacity** - Used vs total storage
- **Dataset List** - All datasets under this pool with their status

### Dataset Status Indicators

Each dataset shows:
- **✅** - Mounted and available
- **⭕️** - Not mounted
- **🔒** - Encrypted dataset
- **→ Status** - Clear text status (Mounted/Not Mounted)

## Menu Structure

```
📦 pool-name
  ├── ✅ Health: ONLINE
  ├── 💾 Used: 2.5T / 10T
  ├── ────────────────
  ├── Datasets:
  ├── ✅   dataset1 🔒
  │   └── → Mounted
  ├── ⭕️   dataset2 🔒
  │   └── → Not Mounted
  └── ✅   dataset3
      └── → Mounted
```

## Real-Time Updates

The menu automatically updates when:
- Datasets are mounted/unmounted
- Pools are imported/exported
- External drives are connected/disconnected
- Every 30 seconds (as backup)

## Visual Legend

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 📦 | ZFS Pool |
| ✅ | Mounted / Healthy |
| ⭕️ | Not Mounted |
| 🔒 | Encrypted |
| ⚠️ | Warning / Unhealthy |
| 💾 | Storage Capacity |
| → | Status Detail |

## Code Changes

### ZFSManager.swift

Added new methods:
```swift
func getDatasets() -> [ZFSDataset]
func getDatasets(forPool poolName: String) -> [ZFSDataset]
```

These allow querying datasets by pool for organized display.

### MenuBarController.swift

Enhanced `updateMenuBar()` to:
1. Show visual icons for pools and health
2. List all datasets under each pool
3. Display mount status and encryption for each dataset
4. Format with indentation for better readability

## Testing

After deploying, test the menu by:

1. **Click the menu bar icon** - You should see detailed pool info
2. **Expand a pool** - Shows all datasets with status
3. **Mount/unmount a dataset**:
   ```bash
   sudo zfs unmount pool/dataset
   ```
4. **Watch the menu update** - Status changes within 0.5 seconds
5. **Mount it back**:
   ```bash
   sudo zfs mount pool/dataset
   ```
6. **Verify status updates** - Should show mounted immediately

## Benefits

✅ **At-a-glance status** - See all dataset states without terminal
✅ **Real-time updates** - Know immediately when mounts change
✅ **Visual indicators** - Icons make status clear
✅ **Better organization** - Datasets grouped by pool
✅ **Encryption visibility** - See which datasets are encrypted
